A new in-house application has been created by one of our developers and is
currently deployed on a development server.

You are now tasked with taking this application into a pre-production environment.
It is required to be a High Availability and Fault Tolerant deployment. The main
goal is to load test the application, the environment should be treated as if it was
Production, where all necessary system level and infrastructure components should be
configured using orchestration and automation tools. Amaysim is interested in
evaluating containerized environments, so the use of containers, and related
frameworks, is at your discretion.

After you have completed this work, you will be tasked to handover this application
stack to your fellow operation team members and after hours support, this handover
should include any potential issues you have identified with the application. You
will be invited back to the amaysim offices to present your findings/work.

Getting Started
You should have a copy of the application artifact, along with credentials to log
into the development server. You will also have received an invite to Slack our
communications channel. Here you can ask questions regarding anything that may be
unclear on the test.
